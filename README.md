# Project-Irrigador
This project was developed with the intention of solving a real problem at SENAI Centro 4.0, where flower irrigation was still done manually. I was tasked with creating a project to address this need. Therefore, I created a basic demonstration project. It reads four moisture sensors and also features an alert function in case the moisture levels exceed certain thresholds.
